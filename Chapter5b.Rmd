**Click anywhere on the graph to add points. The correlation coefficient will be calculated.**	  
	  
<p>The correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of the linear relationship
	  between two variables x and y. To get a sense of the connection between the
	  appearance of points -- (x,y) pairs --  in a scatterplot and the value of r,
	  click anywhere on the graph to add points. To remove points, click the Remove 
	  points button and then mouseover points.</p>
