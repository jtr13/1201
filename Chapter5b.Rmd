# Ch. 5 Joint Probability {-}

Sections covered: 5.1, 5.2

## 5.1 Jointly Distributed Random Variables {-}

Skip *everything but* "Two Discrete Random Variables" pp. 199-200

## 5.2 Expected Values, Covariance, and Correlation {-}

Skip *everything but* "Covariance" pp. 214-215 and "Correlation" pp. 216-218

In both sections, skip double integrals. Focus on the concepts of covariance and correlation. The only formula you need to know is:

$\rho_{X, Y} = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y}$

**Click anywhere on the graph to add points. The correlation coefficient will be calculated.**	  
	  
<p>The correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of the linear relationship
	  between two variables x and y. To get a sense of the connection between the
	  appearance of points -- (x,y) pairs --  in a scatterplot and the value of r,
	  click anywhere on the graph to add points. To remove points, click the Remove 
	  points button and then mouseover points.</p>
