Notes on the chi square test formula on p. 644:

* Write the null hypothesis as a sentence, not as in the book. (For example: "Class and Survival Status are independent.")

* "estimated expected" in the textbook is the same as "expected" used in class

* $i$ and $j$ refer to the number of rows and columns in the table
