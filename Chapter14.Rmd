## 14.3 Two-Way Contingency Tables {-}

Skip: pp. 639-643, including "Testing for Homogeneity"

Focus on "Testing for Independence (Lack of Association)"

Notes on the chi square test formula on p. 644:

* Write the null hypothesis as a sentence, not as in the book. (For example: "Class and Survival Status are independent.")

* "estimated expected" in the textbook is the same as "expected" used in class

* I and J refer to the number of rows and columns in the table

## R {-}

The `chisq.test()` function requires that data be in matrix form:

```{r}
# p. 647, #28
mat <- matrix(c(28, 17, 7, 31, 26, 10, 26, 19, 11), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

dimnames(mat) <- list(`Email_Provider` = c("gmail", "Yahoo", "Other"),
                      `Cell_Phone_Provider` = c("ATT", "Verizon", "Other"))

chisq.test(mat, correct = FALSE)

```

To see the expected values:

```{r}
results <- chisq.test(mat, correct = FALSE)
round(results$expected, 2)
```

Mosaic plot


```{r}
mosaicplot(t(mat), color = c("aliceblue", "cornflowerblue", "navyblue"), main = "")
```

## Practice Exercises {-}

1. **(Class example)** We took a survey involving 20 children and 80 adults. 1 of the children and 49 of the adults drink coffee, while the remainder do not. Does there appear to be a relationship between age (child vs. adult) and coffee drinking status (yes vs. no)?

[Ans]
```{r}
x <- c(1, 49, 19, 31)
dim(x) <- c(2, 2)
x
chisq.test(x, correct = FALSE)
```


------

2. **(Hypothesis Testing) **  In an investigation of alcohol use among college students, each male student in a sample was categorized both according to age group and according to the number of heavy drinking episodes during the previous 30 days.

|              | 18-23 | 21-23 | $\geq$ 24 |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| **None**     | 357   | 293   | 592      |
| **1-2**      | 218   | 285   | 354      |
| **3-4**      | 184   | 218   | 185      |
| **$\geq$ 5** | 328   | 331   | 147      |

Does there appear to be an association between extent of binge drinking and age group in the population from which the sample was selected? Carry out a test of hypotheses at significance level .01.
(Testbook 14.25)

[Ans]

$Î± = .01$ 

$H_0$: the extent of binge drinking and age group are independent

$H_A$: the extent of binge drinking and age group are not independent.

```{r}
data <- c(357, 218, 184, 328, 293, 285, 218, 331, 592, 354, 185, 147)
dim(data) <- c(4, 3)
data
# optional: give names to the rows and columns
dimnames(data) <- list(`Episodes` = c("None", "1-2", "3-4", ">= 5"),`Age Group` = c("18-23", "21-23", ">=24"))

data
chisq.test(data, correct = FALSE)
```



```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Alternatively, we can use R as a calculator.
total <- sum(data)
prob <- data/total
expected <- data # initialize matrix "expected" to be the same size as "data"

for (i in 1:4){
  for(j in 1:3){
    expected[i,j] <- sum(prob[i,])*sum(prob[,j])*total
  }
}

chisq <- sum((data-expected)^2/expected)
chisq
```
$p-value < .01$

Reject $H_0$. There appears to be an association between extent of binge drinking and age group in the population from which the sample was selected.
