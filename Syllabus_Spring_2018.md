<strong><u>Course description</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
This introductory course is designed for students who desire a strong grounding in statistical concepts, and has a greater degree of mathematical rigor than STAT UN1101. Topics include: graphical and numerical summaries of data; the normal distribution, probability, random variables, and sampling distributions; estimation and hypothesis testing for means and proportions; comparing two populations; two-way contingency tables; introduction to linear regression. This course serves as the pre-requisite for ECON UN3412.

Required text:
</p>
<p>
Devore, Jay L. 2016. <em>Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences</em>. 9<sup>th</sup> edition. <ISBN:9781305251809>
</p>
<p>
<em>You need the 9th edition for the exercises; you can use earlier editions for the content.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong><u>Grading procedures</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
Grades will be determined as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Homework + class problem</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test #1</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Test #2</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final</td><td>40%</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<strong><u>Grading scale</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
(Do not rely on any averages that appear in CourseWorks since they may not be accurate for various reasons.)
</p>
<table width = "800">
<tr><td>97% + </td><td>A+</td><td>  </td><td>80% to 83%</td><td>B-</td></tr>
<tr><td>93% to 97%</td><td>A</td><td>  </td><td>75% to 80%</td><td>C+</td></tr>
<tr><td>90% to 93%</td><td>A-</td><td>  </td><td>70% to 75%</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>87% to 90%</td><td>B+</td><td>  </td><td>60% to 70%</td><td>C-</td></tr>
<tr><td>83% to 86%</td><td>B</td><td>  </td><td>below 60%</td><td>F</td></tr>
</table>

Note: The tests and final exam are curved on an individual basis; there is no additional curve in the process of computing final averages.

<strong>Homework</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise indicated, assignments must be submitted on CourseWorks as a <strong>single pdf file</strong> -- TurboScan or similar phone apps can be used for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Homework must be submitted by 11:59pm on the due date for full credit. Late assignments will only be accepted for the first 24 hours after the assignment is due. You are entitled to one late assignment, submitted within 24 hours of the due date, without penalty. After that, 4 points will be deducted for late assignments. After the 24 hour period, CourseWorks will no longer accept homework submissions</strong>. No exceptions will be made unless I receive a note from an academic dean detailing unusual circumstances.
</p>
<p>
If you submit more than one assignment, the last one will be counted.
</p>
<p>
Be sure that homework is clearly labeled and legible.
</p>
<p>
You are encouraged to discuss homework <em>strategies</em> with your classmates and work through examples, but you may not discuss particular homework problems, nor copy all or part of solutions from anywhere. In short, the homework you submit must be your own work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Academic Integrity: </strong>Plagiarism or any other breach of academic integrity will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action. For more information please refer to the <em>The Columbia University Undergraduate Guide to Academic Integrity</em>:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Tests: </strong>Tests, including the final, are cumulative, with a greater emphasis on newer material. Allowable materials include pens, pencils, erasers, a hand-held calculator, and a single (two-sided) 8.5” x 11” sheet of original handwritten notes for the first two tests, and three sheets (each two-sided) for the final. <em>Make-up tests will only be administered in cases of documented emergencies.</em>
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Getting help</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
There are numerous opportunities to get assistance with the class material:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Ask questions during class.
</li>
<li>
Ask questions after class (I will stay after every class if students have questions.)
</li>
<li>
Attend a Statistics Help Room session where tutors answer questions for students in introductory level statistics classes. Hours and locations are posted here: <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu/help-room/">http://stat.columbia.edu/help-room/</a>
</li>
</ol>
