# Ch. 2 Probability {-}

Sections covered: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5  

(2.4 will be covered later in the semester)

## 2.1 Sample Spaces and Events {-}

It is possible to simulate a coin flip using R.
Ex: fair coin, 10 flips (size). _Note: we must indicate replace=TRUE since "H" and "T" can be drawn more than once;_ 

```{r}
sample(x = c("H", "T"), size = 10,  replace = TRUE)
```


Ex: Same conditions as above but now we have a biased coin (probability of heads is 0.8, and the probability of tails is 0.2). 
```{r}
sample(x = c("H", "T"), prob = c(.8, .2), size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```

## 2.2 Axioms, Interpretations, and Properties of Probability {-}

## 2.3 Counting Techniques {-}

### R {-}

**Factorial**

```{r}
factorial(5)
```

**Combinations**

"5 choose 2" = choose 2 items out of 5

```{r}
choose(5, 2)
```

**Permutations**

There is no built-in function to calculate permutations.  You can multiply the number of combinations by *k!*.

Ex. Number of permutations of size 2 that can be formed from 5 distinct items:

```{r}
choose(5,2)*factorial(2)
```

You can create your own function to do this:
```{r}
perm <- function(n, k) {choose(n,k)*factorial(k)}

perm(5,2)
```

## 2.5 Independence {-}

Skip everything before "The Multiplication Rule" on p. 86 (until we return to conditional probability later in the semester)
