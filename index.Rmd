This site contains supplemental materials for Stat 1201, mainly: 1) clarifications on which sections we cover in the textbook (Devore, *Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences* **9th edition**), 2) R code, and 3) links to helpful resources online. It is not in any way a substitute for materials available in CourseWorks.

If you find additional online resources that are helpful to this class, please [create an issue](https://github.com/jtr13/1201/issues/new) or send me an email and I'll add them to this resource. Let me know as well if you find any typos or other mistakes. 

Note that while you're encouraged to look ahead, be sure to circle back to those sections when they're covered in class since content may be added or modified slightly.

## General study tips {-}

The [website for the book *Make It Stick*](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick) offers a summary of the experimentally tested study strategies. The tl;dr is:

* working out problems is better than reviewing notes / textbook
 
* doing mixed reviews is better than focusing on one type of problem at a time 

* learning is hard work; if it seems too easy your study strategy might not be the most effective

* making mistakes and learning from them is a useful strategy (don't wait until you've mastered all of the examples to try a problem)

You've likely heard a lot of these ideas before, but it's worth really thinking about them and putting them into practice.

My advice:

* As you're reading the textbook or working on a problem set, keep a list of questions. Challenge yourself by thinking about how the problem would differ if you changed the setup.

* Try creating your own questions and solving them. 

* Try solving problems in multiple ways. 

* Learn from a variety of sources: class, textbook, *Cartoon Guide*, etc. If you find differences, ask.
